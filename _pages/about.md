The civil rights movement was a campaign from 1954-1968, but it really started during world war 2. The main idea of this campaign was to abolish racial segregation, discrimination, and the jim crow laws. In 1954, the civil rights movement gained momentum when the Supreme Court made segregation illegal in public schools, in the case of brown vs board of education. Rosa Parks’ action in 1955 incited the MIA, Montgomery Improvement Association led by Martin Luther King, to stage the Montgomery bus system boycott. This movement emphasized direct action such as boycotts, freedom rides, stand-ins, marches, and walks.  In 1957, an Alabama high school admitted a group of nine African American teenagers, the little rock nine,  and was protested by fellow students the governor, and the National Guard. The president at the time intervened to assure the students’ safety. In 1962 colleges had also started integrating more African American students into their schools, yet they were all met with the same protests as the High School in Alabama. This movement continued into the 60’s with the support of the new President, John F Kennedy, and his brother. However, it was the events at the Birmingham campaign that convinced the President to fully support this movement. The 1963 Birmingham campaign was one of the most significant movements of the civil rights movement. It was organized by the southern Christian leadership conference in order to draw attention to their attempts to desegregate the city. This is because according to Martin Luther King Jr, it was “probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States”. Their actions at this campaign made huge steps towards the desegregation of the city and helped lead to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They held mass meetings, lunch counter sit-ins, marches, and boycotts. However the only problem was that at the time, they were receiving very little news coverage. In one of the reports, the activists were viewed as too aggressive, making the community skeptical about joining the movement. On June 19th, 1963, The president proposed a Civil Rights Bill to Congress, which was approved in 1964. The bill struck down existing legislation that allowed for discrimination. This captured the attention of the media and brought hundreds of thousands of people together in support of civil rights. Shortly after that, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ended the prejudiced voting system. Sadly, a few days later on August 11th, a violent-6 day riot broke out in Los Angeles, resulting in the death of 34 people. This indicated a period of racially motivated violence in the mid 60s. This was also where we saw the rise of black power, mainly led by Stokely Carmichael against the KKK. This ideology was popularized by the Black Panther Party, which followed the ideology of Malcolm X, 
Malcolm’s rose in popularity in 1957. He was deeply critical of civil rights leaders, such as Martin Luther King, who preached integration
